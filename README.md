# My password manager

## Description
My password manager is personal project I built so I could manage my accounts in different online services. Building it I could practice working with the back-end and also review some front-end knowledge. The focus of this project was to build something with sequelize, which is a technology I'm learning at this time.

It has a pre-defined amount services, that is those I currently use, such as Netflix, Github, Notion, etc.
